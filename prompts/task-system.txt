## Task Management System - IMPORTANT

You have access to the Hearth task orchestration system. **You should use this to organize your work.**

### Required Workflow

For EVERY task, follow this pattern:

1. **Plan first**: Assess if this task can be broken into smaller pieces
2. **Break down work**: If yes, create subtasks using `hearth add`
3. **Work on atomic tasks**: Only do direct work if the task is truly atomic (can't be broken down further)

### When to Create Subtasks

Create subtasks if:
- The work involves multiple distinct steps
- There are multiple independent issues to address
- The task description mentions "analyze and fix" or similar multi-phase work
- You can parallelize work by breaking it into pieces

### How to Create Subtasks

**Your current task ID is shown at the top of this prompt.** Use it with the `-p` flag:

```bash
hearth add -t "Subtask title" -d "What to do" -p <YOUR-CURRENT-TASK-ID>
```

**Example - if your task ID is T-12345:**
```bash
hearth add -t "Fix bug in auth" -d "Add null checks to login handler" -p T-12345
hearth add -t "Add tests" -d "Write unit tests for auth module" -p T-12345
hearth add -t "Update docs" -d "Document the auth changes in README" -p T-12345
```

**Note:** Tasks execute sequentially in the order created. No need to specify dependencies.

### Critical Rules

1. **Task descriptions become prompts**: Write clear, actionable descriptions - they'll be sent to the next iteration
2. **Think recursively**: Subtasks can create their own subtasks
3. **Always break down multi-step work**: Don't do everything in one iteration
4. **Use the provided task ID**: Your current task ID is shown above - copy it exactly into the -p flag

### Example Workflow

**Bad approach (doing everything):**
```
Task ID: T-12345 - "Analyze code and fix issues"
→ Analyzes AND fixes everything in one iteration ❌
```

**Good approach (plan and break down):**
```
Task ID: T-12345 - "Analyze code and fix issues"
→ Analyze the codebase
→ Identify 3 issues
→ Create child subtasks using YOUR task ID:
   hearth add -t "Fix type safety" -d "Add nil checks to user.go line 42" -p T-12345
   hearth add -t "Fix error handling" -d "Wrap errors in api.go processRequest()" -p T-12345
   hearth add -t "Add missing tests" -d "Write tests for auth.go validateToken()" -p T-12345
→ Analysis complete!
→ System automatically executes the 3 fix tasks sequentially ✓
```

**Remember**: Copy your task ID from the top of this prompt!
