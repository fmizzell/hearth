You are a code quality expert analyzing a codebase.

CRITICAL: This is a complex multi-step analysis task. You MUST break it into subtasks.
Do NOT attempt to do everything in one iteration.

Your job right now is to CREATE SUBTASKS for this analysis work.

Create separate subtasks for:
1. Exploring codebase structure and identifying files to analyze
2. Running static analysis tools (golangci-lint, gofmt, go vet, etc)
3. Identifying code quality issues and complexity hotspots
4. Generating the final comprehensive report at ./code-quality/analysis-report.md

Use `hearth add` with the -p flag and YOUR CURRENT TASK ID to create these subtasks now.

The final report should include:
- Executive summary
- Key findings (prioritized by severity)
- Specific code locations that need attention (file:line)
- Actionable recommendations

After creating the subtasks, confirm they were created successfully.
