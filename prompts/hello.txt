You are testing the Hearth task orchestration system.

Please do the following:
1. Give a friendly greeting
2. Show the current working directory
3. List the top-level directories/files (just a quick ls)
4. Create a real subtask that will be executed in the next loop iteration:
   hearth add -t "Count Go files" -d "Find all .go files in the current directory and subdirectories. Count them and show the total. Use: find . -name '*.go' | wc -l"
5. Confirm that the task system is working and that the subtask will be automatically picked up

Keep your response short and simple. The subtask will be automatically executed by the next iteration of the loop.
